            Algebra, branch of mathematics in which arithmetical operations and
            formal manipulations are applied to abstract symbols rather than
            specific numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The notion that there exists such a distinct subdiscipline of
            mathematics, as well as the term algebra to denote it, resulted from
            a slow historical development.

            This article presents that history, tracing the evolution over time
            of the concept of the equation, number systems, symbols for
            conveying and manipulating mathematical statements, and the modern
            abstract structural view of algebra.

            Geometry, the branch of mathematics concerned with the shape of
            individual objects, spatial relationships among various objects, and
            the properties of surrounding space.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, having arisen in
            response to such practical problems as those found in surveying, and
            its name is derived from Greek words meaning “Earth measurement.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually it was realized that geometry need not be limited to the
            study of flat surfaces (plane geometry) and rigid three-dimensional
            objects (solid geometry) but that even the most abstract thoughts
            and images might be represented and developed in geometric terms.

            From shapes and angles to the intricate patterns in nature, discover

            instantaneous rates of change (differential calculus) and the
            summation of infinitely many small factors to determine some whole
            (integral calculus).
          </p>
          <p>
            Two mathematicians, Isaac Newton of England and Gottfried Wilhelm
            Leibniz of Germany, share credit for having independently developed
            the calculus in the 17th century.

          <p>
            Calculus makes it possible to solve problems as diverse as tracking
            the position of a space shuttle or predicting the pressure building
            up behind a dam as the water rises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calculus is now the basic entry point for anyone wishing to study

            science.

          <p>
            Topology, branch of mathematics, sometimes referred to as “rubber
            sheet geometry,” in which two objects are considered equivalent if
            they can be continuously deformed into one another through such
            motions in space as bending, twisting, stretching, and shrinking
            while disallowing tearing apart or gluing together parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The area of topology dealing with abstract objects is referred to as
            general, or point-set, topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main topics of interest in topology are the properties that
            remain unchanged by such continuous deformations. Topology, while
            similar to geometry, differs from geometry in that geometrically
            equivalent objects often share numerically measured quantities, such
            as lengths or angles, while topologically equivalent objects
            resemble each other in a more qualitative sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            General topology overlaps with another important area of topology
            called
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/algebraic-topology"
              >algebraic topology</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            These areas of specialization form the two major subdisciplines of
            topology that developed during its relatively modern history.
